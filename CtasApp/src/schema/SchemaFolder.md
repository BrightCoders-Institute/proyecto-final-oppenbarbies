# Schema Folder

The `schema/` folder in this repository is dedicated to defining the data schemas and types used in our application. Schemas describe the structure and constraints of data, while types define the shape of data objects. Organizing these definitions in the `schema/` folder helps to keep the data models centralized and makes it easier to manage and enforce consistency across the application.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `schema/` folder is to define and manage the data schemas and types used throughout your application. By having a separate folder for schemas, we can easily reference and reuse these definitions across various components and modules.
