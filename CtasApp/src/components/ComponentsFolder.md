# Components Folder

The `components/` folder  serves as a central location for creating and organizing various reusable components that form the building blocks of the application. These components play a crucial role in enhancing code maintainability, reusability, and readability.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `components/` folder is to encapsulate different UI elements and functional units of the application into modular components. By doing so, we can simplify the development process and promote a consistent and unified design across the application.
