# Hooks Folder

The `hooks/` folder is dedicated to creating personalized custom hooks. React custom hooks are a powerful feature that allows you to encapsulate and reuse logic across different components. By organizing hooks in the `hooks/` folder, we can easily manage and share these custom hooks throughout your React application.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `hooks/` folder is to centralize the custom hooks that provide specific functionalities and can be used across multiple components. Custom hooks help to keep component logic clean and maintainable by abstracting complex functionalities into reusable units.
