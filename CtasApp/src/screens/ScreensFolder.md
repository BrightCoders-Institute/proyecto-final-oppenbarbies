# Screens Folder

The `screens/` folder  houses the individual Screen components that make up the various sections and pages of your application. Each Screen component represents a distinct view or user interface, allowing users to interact with different functionalities and content within the app.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `screens/` folder is to organize and manage the Screen components, making it easier to navigate and maintain different views within the application. By having separate files for each Screen, you can focus on specific functionalities and keep the overall codebase more structured and modular.
