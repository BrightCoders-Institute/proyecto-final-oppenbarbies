# Database Folder

The `database/` folder contains files that manage database connections and execute queries for different databases, including Firestore and potentially other databases. These files play a crucial role in establishing communication with the databases, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and handling data interactions within the application.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `database/` folder is to centralize the database-related functionality and separate it from the rest of the application logic. By doing so, it becomes easier to manage, maintain, and switch between different databases if needed.
