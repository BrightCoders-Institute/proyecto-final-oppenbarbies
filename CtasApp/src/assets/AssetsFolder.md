# Usage of the "assets" folder

The "assets" folder is commonly used in web development or application projects to store multimedia resources and static files. Its main purpose is to keep all elements that will be used in the site or application, such as images, icons, fonts, and other assets, organized and separated.

By placing assets in a dedicated folder like "assets," managing and maintaining the project becomes easier. It also helps to avoid mixing source code files with multimedia elements, contributing to a cleaner and more readable structure.
