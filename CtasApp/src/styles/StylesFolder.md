# Styles Folder

The `styles/` folder is dedicated to organizing all the style-related files and assets used throughout the application. It contains the various stylesheets, theme files, and other resources that define the visual appearance and layout of the user interface.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `styles/` folder is to centralize all the styles and assets, making it easier to manage and maintain the application's visual design. By separating the styles from the application logic, we can keep the codebase clean and promote reusability of styles across different components.
