# Navigation Folder

The `navigation/` folder contains files dedicated to creating and managing the navigation between different screens or routes within your application. These files help to organize and handle the routing logic, enabling users to navigate seamlessly between different sections of the app.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `navigation/` folder is to centralize the navigation logic, making it easier to maintain and update the app's routing. By having separate files for navigation, we can also keep the main application files cleaner and more focused on specific functionalities.
