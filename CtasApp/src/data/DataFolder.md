# Data Folder

The `data/` folder serves as a storage location for data files in the JSON format. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for both humans and machines to read and write. Storing data in JSON files provides a simple and flexible way to manage and manipulate structured data.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `data/` folder is to organize and manage various JSON files that contain data used by the application. These data files can include configurations, settings, sample data, or any other information needed by the application.
