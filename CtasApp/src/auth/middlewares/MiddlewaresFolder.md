# Middlewares Folder

The `middlewares/` folder houses custom middleware functions designed to protect routes and enforce authentication for specific parts of the application. These middleware functions play a critical role in enhancing the security and user experience of the application by controlling access to certain endpoints.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `middlewares/` folder is to centralize and manage the middleware functions responsible for handling user authentication and authorization. By isolating these functions, we can ensure that every route or API endpoint requiring authentication can easily incorporate the necessary checks without duplicating code.
