# Auth Folder

The Auth folder is dedicated to creating the necessary files and components for user authentication. It plays a crucial role in securing the application and ensuring that only authorized users can access protected resources and perform specific actions.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Auth folder is to centralize all the functionalities related to user authentication, including registration, login, logout, password recovery, and more. By isolating these features, it becomes easier to maintain and update the authentication system independently from other parts of the application.

## Contents

The Auth folder contains the following files and components:

1. `register.js`: This file handles the user registration process. It allows new users to create an account by providing necessary information and validates the data to ensure accuracy.

2. `login.js`: Responsible for user login functionality. It prompts users to enter their credentials and verifies them against the stored data in the database.

3. `logout.js`: Deals with user logout and session termination. When invoked, it will clear the user's session data and log them out from the system.

4. `password_recovery.js`: This file manages the process of password recovery for users who have forgotten their passwords. It allows users to reset their passwords securely.

5. `auth_utils.js`: A utility file that contains helper functions and constants related to authentication, such as password encryption and token generation.

6. `middlewares/`: This folder contains custom middleware functions used for protecting routes and ensuring that only authenticated users can access certain parts of the application.
